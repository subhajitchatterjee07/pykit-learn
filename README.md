## This Repository hosts all important concepts in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Generative Models
I am trying to implement them all from scratch.

Models implemented till date:

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Trees and Random Forests
4. Stone-Grad ( A dynamic reverse-mode autodiff engine)
5. Bigram Language Model
6. Probabilistic Language Model
7. Encoder-decoder Transformer Model (Attention is all you need)
8. Stone-gippity ( Ultra Small GPT implementation)
8. Stone-gippity-2 (soon)
